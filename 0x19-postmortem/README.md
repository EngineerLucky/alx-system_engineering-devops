A postmortem is a detailed analysis conducted after a significant incident, such as a system outage or service disruption, to understand the root cause and implement corrective measures. It typically includes an issue summary, outlining the duration and impact of the incident, and a timeline of events leading to the resolution. The postmortem examines the root cause in depth, explaining what specifically caused the issue and how it was fixed. Finally, it outlines corrective and preventative measures to improve processes, such as enhanced monitoring, better testing procedures, and specific tasks to prevent future occurrences. This thorough review helps ensure similar incidents are less likely to happen again, improving overall system reliability and user satisfaction.
